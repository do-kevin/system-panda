# **Prisma ORM**
SystemPanda uses Prisma as its database layer, letting you define your data as a JavaScript object with an interface similar to a Prisma schema, that is then mapped to a Prisma data model.

- You can execute Prisma operations yourself as mentioned in [CLI](https://github.com/serhankileci/system-panda/blob/main/docs/cli.md).
- For collections API and examples, refer to [Collections](https://github.com/serhankileci/system-panda/blob/main/docs/collections.md).
